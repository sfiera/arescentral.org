  | ## About Ares
  | 
  | Ares is a tactical space-combat game, combining elements of both arcade shoters and real-time
  | strategy games.
  | 
  | ### History
  | 
  | Ares was written by Nathan Lamont of [Bigger Planet][biggerplanet] for the classic Mac OS and
  | was originally published by Changeling Software.  Changeling Software went out of business
  | while launching the game in 1998, and the game was later released as shareware by [Ambrosia
  | Software][ambrosia].  Ambrosia saw through another generation of the game, including the
  | release of a tool for creating plugins, called Hera, in 2001.  However, following the release
  | of Mac OS X, the game languished on the outdated Classic platform.
  | 
  | In November 2008, with the permission of Ambrosia, Nathan Lamont released the source code of
  | the game as open-source software under the [GNU General Public License 2.0][gpl2].  In
  | addition, much of the media was released under Creative Commons licenses.  This led to the
  | creation of two projects aiming to bring the Ares experience back: [Xsera][xsera], a complete
  | reimplementation which uses the original game as a reference, and [Antares][antares], which is
  | a direct port of the old game.
