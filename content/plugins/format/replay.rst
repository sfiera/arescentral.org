Replay
======

A replay records a playthrough of a level. On the main screen, the
“Demo” button plays a replay as a demonstration of gameplay.

Do I need it?
-------------

No. The `factory scenario`_ has three replays, but adding replays to
plugins isn’t currently supported. The format is likely to change in the
future.
