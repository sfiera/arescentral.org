Interface
=========

Interfaces define the user interface of Antares, outside of gameplay.

Do I need it?
-------------

No. There are built-in interfaces. Replacing them isnâ€™t currently
supported.

Naming
------

The interfaces are named:

*  ``main-screen``
*  ``select-level``
*  ``briefing``
*  ``loading``
*  ``help``
*  ``play-again/normal``
*  ``play-again/tutorial``
*  ``play-again/lose``
*  ``options/sound``
*  ``options/keys``
