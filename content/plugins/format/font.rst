Font
====

Antares has five built-in fonts. In the future, it might be possible to
replace them, but for now, it isn’t supported.

Do I need it?
-------------

No. There are built-in fonts. Replacing them isn’t currently supported.

Naming
------

The five fonts are named:

*  ``button`` (used for most buttons)
*  ``button-small`` (used for “small” buttons)
*  ``computer`` (used for in-game computer)
*  ``tactical`` (used for in-game status messages)
*  ``title`` (use for prologues and epilogues)
