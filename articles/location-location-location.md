Another year, another anniversary

Today, we celebrate the anniversary of the release of the Ares source code by reopening the
AresCentral domain name—this time, as AresCentral.org.

AresCentral.com was the original website for Ares: the folder *"Web Site urls ƒ"* which comes with
the game has two links to it (one for Netscape and one for Internet Explorer), and now those same
locations will lead to here, the new home of Ares on the web.  We're proud to be keeping the
tradition unbroken.
